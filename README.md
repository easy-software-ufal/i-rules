# Improving Transformation Rules to Avoid Useless Mutants


Useless mutants (eg., equivalents and duplicated) contribute to increasing costs of the mutation testing. An equivalent mutant is a mutant that has the same behavior as the original program. This way, this mutant is useless. A duplicated mutant is a mutant that has the same behavior as another one. Thus, one of them is useless. Previous research has focused mainly on detecting useless mutants only after they are generated and compiled. The few solutions that try to prevent the mutant from being generated either do not provide practical effectiveness in their outcome, are specialized to domain-specific mutants, depend on expensive resources, or work with second-order mutants. In previous work, we proposed improving the transformation rules embedded in the mutation operators in order to avoid useless mutants. This work extends our previous findings in several ways. We present *i-rule*, a notation to avoid useless mutants. We define an *i-rule* as a triple (*term*, *transformations*, *constraints*) and differentiate *i-rules* to avoid equivalents (E-RULE) and to avoid duplicated mutants (D-RULE). Also, we present a strategy to help mutation tool developers find out occurrence patterns that lead to new *i-rules*. In our previous conference paper, we instantiated the strategy with programs automatically generated by the JDolly program generator, which lead us to discover 48 *i-rules* for three common mutation testing tools for Java (MuJava, Major, and Pit). In this article, we instantiate the strategy with manually-written Java programs, which lead us to find out 51 new *i-rules* for the same mutation tools. To evaluate the effectiveness of the *i-rules* on reducing costs, we implement 32 of them in the MuJava tool and execute with classes of well-known projects such as *ant*, *bcel*, and *commons-lang*. The results show we reduced the number of mutants by almost 20% on average and saved time to generate the mutants, thus demonstrating the potential of our approach for reducing mutation costs.

# Evaluation 01 - Strategy

![The strategy process](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/easy-software-ufal/i-rules/master/images/strategy.png)


Figure above summarizes the strategy process.

 1. **Step 1.** We begin by providing a set of programs. Any program(s) could be used, however, we recommend that these programs be preferably small, because we will parse them manually to extract the *i-rules*. 
 2. **Step2.** For each program, a mutation testing tool generates mutants. We recommend enabling all mutation operators allowing the generation of the full set of mutants. 
 3. **Step 3.** Oracles must examine the original program and its mutants to identify potential equivalent and duplicated candidates. Any solution that detects or suggests the equivalent and duplicated mutants can be used. 
 4. **Step 4.** A program gathers the results from Step~3 and cluster the candidates according to the mutation operators and transformations applied, and sort these groups according to the number of candidates. For instance, if the strategy detects many candidates of duplicated mutants with transformations of the ROR (Relational Operator Replacement) and COI (Conditional Operator Insertion) operators, the program cluster these mutants candidates and hints this group as a priority for manual analysis.
 5. **Step 5.** We manually analyze the clusters with more candidates to extract the *i-rules*. We reason that clusters with more candidates may indicate an occurrence pattern that leads to the identification of an E-RULE or D-RULE. To perform the manual analysis, we perceive all candidates in a cluster and if identified a pattern, we perform a *manual slicing*. This means we create a simple program that isolates the components of the program that are concerned with the mutation. We then execute tests (manually or automatically generated) against this program to bring up behavioral changes. If no behavioral changes are detected, we work to extract the *i-rule* that will prevent this useless mutant from occurring again.

### RQ 1: How many *i-rules* can be discovered with the support of our strategy?

```
At the end of the two rounds, we identified 30 E-RULEs and 69 D-RULEs in all three mutation testing tools, with the following distribution:
- MuJava: 16 E-RULEs and 36 D-RULEs
- Major: 9 E-RULEs and 14 D-RULEs
- Pit: 5 E-RULEs and 19 D-RULEs
Our results point out that there are possibilities to improve transformations to avoid useless mutants in all tools.

## RQ 1: _How many mutants are likely-subsumed?_

```
Considering a whole set of mutants generated by the original MuJava implementation, our _i-rules_ avoided the generation of 19.79% of them, all identified as useless mutants.
Out of these, 16.81% are duplicate mutants, and 2.98% are equivalent to the original program.
This way, we avoid the cost of generation, compilation, and execution of the tests on these mutants.
In addition, by eliminating equivalent ones, we also avoid the cost of manually analyzing these mutants.
```


## RQ 2: _Which i-rules apply most to avoid equivalent and duplicate mutants?_

```
Regarding the _e-rules_ related to equivalent mutants, we managed to avoid 4,030 mutants. 
The AOIS-01 (MuJava) _e-rule_, itself, was responsible for the vast majority of avoided equivalent mutants.
From the 9 implemented _e-rules_, five were triggered successfully at least once,
what means that 4 _e-rules_ have not been applied.
Regarding the applied _d-rules_, they avoided 22,693 mutants.
Six _d-rules_ were responsible for approximately 89% of the avoided duplicate mutants. 
From the 23 _d-rules_ implemented, 19 were triggered successfully at least once, whereas and 4 _d-rules_ have not been applied.
We also found that some _i-rules_ are challenging to detect by *TCE*, which shows that we can use both solutions in conjunction to reduce even more the number of useless mutants.
Note that these results links to the set of programs evaluated, 
as well as to the implementation of the mutation operators in the MuJava-AUM mutation tool.
```


## RQ 3: _What is the overhead of executing our i-rules in industrial-scale systems?_

```
Although our _i-rules_ introduce an additional overhead, the payoff amount is 15% on average. 
Because we generate and compile fewer mutants, we have fewer I/O operations. 
These operations are more expensive than executing our _i-rules_.
```
