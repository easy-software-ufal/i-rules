# Improving Transformation Rules to Avoid Useless Mutants


Useless mutants (eg., equivalents and duplicated) contribute to increasing costs of the mutation testing. An equivalent mutant is a mutant that has the same behavior as the original program. This way, this mutant is useless. A duplicated mutant is a mutant that has the same behavior as another one. Thus, one of them is useless. Previous research has focused mainly on detecting useless mutants only after they are generated and compiled. The few solutions that try to prevent the mutant from being generated either do not provide practical effectiveness in their outcome, are specialized to domain-specific mutants, depend on expensive resources, or work with second-order mutants. In previous work, we proposed improving the transformation rules embedded in the mutation operators in order to avoid useless mutants. This work extends our previous findings in several ways. We present *i-rule*, a notation to avoid useless mutants. We define an *i-rule* as a triple (*term*, *transformations*, *constraints*) and differentiate \textit{i-rules} to avoid equivalents (E-RULE) and to avoid duplicated mutants (D-RULE). Also, we present a strategy to help mutation tool developers find out occurrence patterns that lead to new \textit{i-rules}. In our previous conference paper, we instantiated the strategy with programs automatically generated by the JDolly program generator, which lead us to discover 48 *i-rules* for three common mutation testing tools for Java (MuJava, Major, and Pit). In this article, we instantiate the strategy with manually-written Java programs, which lead us to find out 51 new *i-rules* for the same mutation tools. To evaluate the effectiveness of the \textit{i-rules} on reducing costs, we implement 32 of them in the MuJava tool and execute with classes of well-known projects such as *ant*, *bcel*, and *commons-lang*. The results show we reduced the number of mutants by almost 20% on average and saved time to generate the mutants, thus demonstrating the potential of our approach for reducing mutation costs.

# Evaluation 01 - Strategy



The docker-compose file shown below runs Hunor with the necessary parameters to generate the DMSG that represents the dynamic subsuming relationship on all project targets.
 
With Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine, follow these steps:

1) Create or use an existing maven project.
2) Add the *docker-compose.yml* file to the project root, along with the [*config.json*](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mutation-subsumption/subsumption-relations/master/config-discover.json) configuration file.
3) Run docker-composer with the command:

*docker-compose.yml*
```yml
version: '3'
services:
  hunor:
    image: mutationsubsumption/hunor:0.9.8
    working_dir: /opt/src
    command: [
      'hunor-pgen',
      '-j', '/usr/local/openjdk-8',
